It's typical Portuguese pastry.
Unfortunately, there is only one left... we will make a little game to decide who will get it.
If a player guesses a secret number, he or she wins it!

> Okay, if you still pretend not to be hungry - the game goal will be to guess the *wrong* number

### 🌱 Must-have features
- A secret number will be generated. To make things fair, the number should be between 1 and (learners in the class)
- A user can enter a guess (what html element can be useful for this?)
- When he or she pushes the "play" button, the number will be compared to the secret number
- Depending on the outcome, an alert box will show:
    - Awesome! You number (actual number) was correct. You can be named many things, hungry not being one of them.
    - Bummer... You guessed (guess) and the secret number was (secret number).
    
### 🌼 Nice-to-have features
When a guess was just one number from the secret number, show another message: "So close, but you just missed it! Are you in a class that started on the thirteenth or what?"
